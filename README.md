# ðŸš— Car Health Report Generation using Generative AI

This project is designed to assist in vehicle diagnostics by analyzing sensor data and detecting visible damage in car components through image analysis. By leveraging Generative AI and computer vision, the system provides insights into vehicle health and recommends maintenance actions for improved performance and safety.

## Overview

This Car Health Report Generation project integrates several key elements:
- **Sensor Data Analysis**: Real-time monitoring of critical car health indicators, including engine temperature, oil pressure, tire pressure, and battery voltage. The system simulates sensor data and tracks anomalies, helping users detect abnormal values and prevent potential issues.
  
- **Image-based Damage Detection**: Using computer vision, the system identifies visible damage in car components based on uploaded images. This damage analysis, along with anomaly detection from sensor data, enables an overall assessment of the car's health.

- **Anomaly Detection**: The system flags values outside normal operational thresholds, providing real-time alerts on any issues, such as overheating, low oil pressure, or low battery voltage, to help maintain vehicle safety and functionality.

- **User Interface**: A Gradio-based user interface enables users to interact seamlessly with the system, allowing them to upload images, view real-time sensor data plots, and receive detailed analysis and maintenance recommendations.
